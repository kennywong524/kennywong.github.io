## Classes I taught at Berkeley
1. [CS C88C: Computational Structures In Data Science (Fall '24)](https://c88c.org/fa24/) - Tutor under Prof. [John DeNero](https://denero.org/)

- Introduction to computer science in the context of data science. This course provides a rigorous introduction to the programming topics that appear in Foundations of Data Science, expands the repertoire of computational concepts, and exposes students to techniques of abstraction at several levels, including layers of software and machines from a programmers‚Äô point of view. It provides an understanding of the structures that underlie the programs, algorithms, and languages used in data science and other settings. It focuses on paradigms for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, and declarative programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a valuable side effect of studying these general techniques. It provides practical experience with composing larger computational systems through several significant programming projects.

2. [IEOR 120: Principles of Engineering (Fall '24)](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/indeng-120) - Reader under Prof. [Daniel Pirutinsky](https://pirutinsky.ieor.berkeley.edu/)

- This upper division course focuses on teaching fundamental concepts of economic analysis for engineering decision making: Capital flows, effect of time and interest rate. Different methods of evaluation of alternatives and project management. Stocks & Bonds Pricing. Different methods of valuations: WACC, COMP. Minimum-cost life and replacement analysis. Depreciation and taxes. Uncertainty; preference under risk; decision analysis. Capital sources and their effects. Economic studies. Formerly Engineering 120.
