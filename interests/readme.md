# 🤙🏻 Hobbies
🎙️ Outside of school, I love to sing with my indie Acapella group on campus, [**Artists in Resonance (AiR)**](https://www.instagram.com/artistsinresonance/). Check out some of our performances [here](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtistsInResonance/videos?themeRefresh=1). (shameless plug LOL)

✈️🎾 Apart from tennis, I also love travelling to different places and hike in my free time during golden hours. Check out some of my travel vlogs [here](https://www.youtube.com/@kennyw589).

🇸🇬 I serve as Head of External for the [**Singapore Student Association @ Berkeley (SSA)**](https://ssa.studentorg.berkeley.edu/leadership/). We act as a home away from home for students in UC Berkeley who are associated with or interested in the Singaporean culture by organizing fun events throughout the year, ranging from social events like Friendsgiving, to professional events like company visits and graduate school talks.
