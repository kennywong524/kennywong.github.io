# Hobbies
Outside of school, I love to sing with my indie Acapella group on campus, [**Artists in Resonance (AiR)**](https://www.instagram.com/artistsinresonance/). Check out some of our performances [here](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtistsInResonance/videos?themeRefresh=1). (shameless plug :))

Apart from hiking and running, I love travelling to different cities in the US and studying how they are planned through maps. I'm also a huge public transit nerd. Check out some of my travel vlogs [here](https://www.youtube.com/@kennyw589).

I also served as Head of External for the [**Singapore Student Association @ Berkeley (SSA)**](https://ssa.studentorg.berkeley.edu/leadership/).
