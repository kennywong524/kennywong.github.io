I'm a junior at the [**University of California, Berkeley**](https://www.berkeley.edu/), majoring in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) and minoring in Data Science & Mathematics. 

I am broadly interested in data-driven and optimized decision-making under uncertainty, with applications in transportation systems, supply chains, service operations, revenue management, urban analytics, and online platforms. My research integrates theoretical methods from operations research and applied economics with empirical data science tools to understand and improve the design and operation of complex systems. I am also deeply interested in the economics of innovation, particularly in how emerging technologies‚Äîsuch as artificial intelligence and large language models‚Äîreshape human, organizational behavior, productivity, and societal dynamics.

This summer, I am a visiting research fellow at [**Columbia Business School**](https://business.columbia.edu/), collaborating with Professor [**Paul Glasserman**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/paul-glasserman) in the department of [**Decisions, Risk, and Operations (DRO)**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/divisions/dro)  to empirically investigate whether large language models (LLMs) understand chronology and sequential data. 

At Berkeley, I am fortunate to work with and be advised by Professor [**Chiwei Yan**](https://yanchiwei.github.io/) at the [**Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research**](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/), [**Berkeley College of Engineering**](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/) to develop and enhance shared rides pricing and matching algorithms, as well as optimizing supply chain games codebase. 

I also have a privilege of working under Professor [**Abishek Nagaraj**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/nagaraj-abhishek/), at the [**Data Innovation & AI Lab**](https://thedatainnovationlab.com/), [**UC Berkeley Haas School of Business**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) to explore Human Computer Interaction and productivity after the emergence of AI tools in open source platforms.

I love being outdoor: hiking the [Columbia River Gorge Waterfalls](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHQTwDUoByfMALZF_voISsyeZZgYFGMX/view?usp=sharing) in Oregon, running the [Central Park Loop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wwBYRMOQZMrw8VbnTr5QRI58awod7uAX/view?usp=sharing) in New York, and watching the daily [California Sunset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c3r-572HvjX8nyTydSRLMGhnvlq8lkCb/view?usp=sharing) in Berkeley are some of my all-time favorites! (Follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/174517136)) I'm also a big music fan; I regularly sing, play the piano and guitar with my acapella group on campus.
