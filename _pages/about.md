I'm a junior at the [**University of California, Berkeley**](https://www.berkeley.edu/), majoring in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) and minoring in Data Science & Mathematics. My professional interests lie in applied ML & LLMs, optimization, and their applications in transportation systems, urban analytics, supply chain, and finance.

My research interest lies in the intersection between Data Analytics and Operations Research. This summer, I am collaborating with Professor [**Paul Glasserman**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/paul-glasserman) in the department of [**Decisions, Risk, and Operations (DRO)**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/divisions/dro) at [**Columbia Business School**](https://business.columbia.edu/) to empirically investigate whether large language models (LLMs) understand chronology and sequential data. I am currently working with Professor [**Chiwei Yan**](https://yanchiwei.github.io/) at the [**Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research**](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/), [**Berkeley College of Engineering**](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/) to develop and enhance shared rides pricing and matching algorithms, as well as optimizing supply chain games codebase. I also have a privilege of working under Professor [**Abishek Nagaraj**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/nagaraj-abhishek/), at [**Data Innovation Lab**](https://thedatainnovationlab.com/), [**UC Berkeley Haas School of Business**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) to explore Human Computer Interaction and productivity after the emergence of AI tools in open source platforms.
