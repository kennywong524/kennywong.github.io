🔌 Optimizing for a more efficient world!

👨🏻‍💻⚡ I'm a rising sophomore at the [**University of California, Berkeley**](https://www.berkeley.edu/), majoring in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) and Data Science with a minor in Computer Science (CS).

🥼 My professional interests lie in *applied AI & ML models, predictive analytics in revenue management, financial engineering, and process optimization & automation*. 

🧪 My research interest lies in the intersection between Generative AI and Ethics, which I pursued as an undergraduate researcher at [**UC Berkeley Haas School of Business**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) under Professor [**David Evan Harris**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/harris-david/), one of the top 100 influential figures in AI by the [*Business Insider*](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ai-100-2023-the-people-who-make-ai-intelligent-2023-10). I also have a privilege to currently work with Professor [**Chiwei Yan**](https://yanchiwei.github.io/) under the [**IEOR Department**](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) at Berkeley Engineering to develop and enhance shared rides pricing and matching algorithms, as well as learning resources.

🧐 I also love teaching! I currently serve at as an undergraduate reader for *IEOR 120: Principles of Engineering Economics* at Berkeley IEOR and an undergraduate tutor for [CS 88: Computational Structures in Data Science](https://c88c.org/fa24/) at [**Berkeley's College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS)**](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/) for fall 2024.

🇸🇬🇹🇭 Having spent 10+ years abroad, I possess a multicultural flexibility and awareness, as well as strong engineering and analytical acumen. In my free time, you can find me exploring the globe 🌍, hiking scenic trails, and hitting the tennis court 🎾!

## Selected Experiences

💵💳 In partnership with [**FinTech Academy**](https://fin.edu.sg/) and [**KPMG**](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home.html), I founded and organized the biggest, first-ever fintech case competition for high schoolers in Singapore. I also co-edited [**“The FinTech Nation”**](https://www.fintechnation.io/), one of the first books about Singapore's financial technology journey.

👷🏻 I serve as the Director of Programs & Events for the Berkeley chapter of the [**Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers (IISE)**](https://iise.berkeley.edu/), the biggest student organization for IEOR majors on campus. 

👔 I have experiences working for companies such as [**GUESS? Inc.**](https://www.guess.com/us/en/home/) and [**Expedia Group**](https://expediagroup.com/) to help drive data-driven decision-making and their strategic initiatives.

### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, Java, MATLAB, Tableau
