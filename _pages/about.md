I'm a junior at the [**University of California, Berkeley**](https://www.berkeley.edu/), majoring in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) and minoring in Data Science & Mathematics. My professional interests lie in applied ML & LLMs, optimization, and their applications in transportation systems, urban analytics, supply chain, and finance. My research interest lies in the intersection between Data Analytics and Operations Research. 

This summer, I am a visiting research fellow at [**Columbia Business School**](https://business.columbia.edu/), collaborating with Professor [**Paul Glasserman**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/paul-glasserman) in the department of [**Decisions, Risk, and Operations (DRO)**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/divisions/dro)  to empirically investigate whether large language models (LLMs) understand chronology and sequential data. 

At Berkeley, I am fortunate to work with and be advised by Professor [**Chiwei Yan**](https://yanchiwei.github.io/) at the [**Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research**](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/), [**Berkeley College of Engineering**](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/) to develop and enhance shared rides pricing and matching algorithms, as well as optimizing supply chain games codebase. I also have a privilege of working under Professor [**Abishek Nagaraj**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/nagaraj-abhishek/), at the [**Data Innovation Lab**](https://thedatainnovationlab.com/), [**UC Berkeley Haas School of Business**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) to explore Human Computer Interaction and productivity after the emergence of AI tools in open source platforms.

I love being outdoor: hiking the [Columbia River Gorge Waterfalls](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHQTwDUoByfMALZF_voISsyeZZgYFGMX/view?usp=sharing) in Oregon, running the [Central Park Loop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wwBYRMOQZMrw8VbnTr5QRI58awod7uAX/view?usp=sharing) in New York, and watching the daily [California Sunset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c3r-572HvjX8nyTydSRLMGhnvlq8lkCb/view?usp=sharing) in Berkeley are some of my all-time favorites! (Follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/174517136)) I'm also a big music fan; I regularly sing, play the piano and guitar with my acapella group on campus.
