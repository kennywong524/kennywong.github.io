👨🏻‍💻⚡ I'm a junior at the [**University of California, Berkeley**](https://www.berkeley.edu/), majoring in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) and minoring in Data Science & Mathematics.

🥼 My professional interests lie in applied AI & ML, optimization, and their applications in transportation systems, urban analytics, supply chain, and finance.

🧪 My research interest lies in the intersection between Data Analytics and Operations Research. I am currently working with Professor [**Chiwei Yan**](https://yanchiwei.github.io/) at the [**Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research**](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/), [**Berkeley College of Engineering**](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/) to develop and enhance shared rides pricing and matching algorithms, as well as optimizing supply chain games codebase. This summer, I am collaborating with Professor [**Paul Glasserman**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/paul-glasserman) in the department of [**Decisions, Risk, and Operations (DRO)**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/divisions/dro) at [**Columbia Business School**](https://business.columbia.edu/) to empirically investigate whether large language models (LLMs) understand chronology and sequential data.

I also have a privilege of working under Professor [**Abishek Nagaraj**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/nagaraj-abhishek/), at [**Data Innovation Lab**](https://thedatainnovationlab.com/), [**UC Berkeley Haas School of Business**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) to explore Human Computer Interaction and productivity after the emergence of AI tools in open source platforms.

🧐 I also love teaching! I currently serve as an undergraduate reader for [**IEOR 142A: Machine Learning & Data Analytics**](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/indeng-142a), [**IEOR 172: Probability & Risk Analysis for Engineers**](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/indeng-120) at Berkeley IEOR and an undergraduate tutor for [**CS 88: Computational Structures in Data Science**](https://c88c.org/fa24/) at [**Berkeley's College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS)**](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/) for fall 2024 & spring 2025.
