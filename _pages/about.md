🔌 Optimizing for a more efficient world!

👨🏻‍💻⚡ I'm a rising sophomore at Berkeley, majoring in **Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR)** with a minor in **Data Science** and **Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS)**.

🧪🥼 My core academic interest lies in applied AI & ML models, predictive analytics in revenue management, financial engineering, and process optimization & automation. My research interest also lies in the intersection between AI and Ethics, which I pursue as an undergraduate researcher at [*UC Berkeley Haas School of Business*](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) under Professor David Evan Harris, one of the top 100 influential figures in AI by the [*Business Insider*](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ai-100-2023-the-people-who-make-ai-intelligent-2023-10). I also serve as a Director of Programs & Events for the Berkeley chapter of the [*Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers (IISE)*](https://iise.berkeley.edu/), the biggest student organization for IEOR majors on campus.

🇸🇬🇹🇭 Having spent 10+ years abroad, I possess a multicultural flexibility and awareness, as well as strong engineering and analytical acumen. In my free time, you can find me exploring the globe 🌍, hiking scenic trails, and hitting the tennis court 🎾!

## Selected Experiences

💵💳 In partnership with [*FinTech Academy*](https://fin.edu.sg/) and [*KPMG*](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home.html), I founded and organized the biggest, first-ever fintech case competition for high schoolers in Singapore which included producing videos and study guides for students and faculty members to learn more about financial technologies. I also co-edited [*“The FinTech Nation”*](https://www.fintechnation.io/), one of the first books about Singapore's financial technology journey.

## ✍🏻 Projects

📈🤖 My most robust project to date involves deep learning, model building and visualizing data. I employed *Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)* to predict stock prices, with 90% accuracy with the market. We also conducted sentiment analysis on *Elon Musk's tweets* to gain insights on their influences on TSLA prices 🚙. Ultimately, we created a dashboard using *Streamlit* to visualize stock prices and predictions, integrating sentiment analysis results for comprehensive insights.
