### Delay-Aware Flight Routes Optimization & Prediction
- Inspired by the ‚ÄúPredict-Then-Optimize‚Äù framework, I used gradient boosting & random forest algorithms to predict delay time for each airline, destination pair, then feed it into a single-stage stochastic program we formulated to suggest the optimal route with minimal delay-to-cost ratio

### Stock Market Analysis for Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo
- Applied advanced data analysis and utilized Pandas to extract financial data from [*Google Finance API*](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281?hl=en).
- Conducted *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to identify key events including market crashes and stock splits.
- Analyzed and classified stocks based on riskiness through financial metrics such as moving averages & RSI using *Seaborn's and Matplotlib's clustermap* to visualize correlations between different stocks.
- Crafted a comprehensive financial analysis report that unveils key insights for each bank.

### Stock Market Prediction Model using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) & Sentiment Analysis
- Employed *Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)* RNN to predict stock prices, with 90% accuracy with the market.
- Conducted sentiment analysis on *Elon Musk's tweets* to gain insights on their influences on TSLA prices.
- Created a dashboard using *Streamlit* to visualize stock prices and predictions, integrating sentiment analysis results for comprehensive insights.

### 2-D Tile-based World Generator
- Designed and implemented a randomly generated 2D tile-based world exploration engine taking in user-inputted seeds with integrated avatar interactivity and scalable features
- Developed a dynamic route feature, which deployed monsters on certain tiles and displayed paths from them to the user, enhancing the user‚Äôs ability to choose the optimal pathway.
- Implemented A ‚ÄúHeads Up Display‚Äù (HUD) that provides additional information that maybe useful to the user. At the bare minimum, this should include Text that describes the tile currently under the mouse pointer.

### Spam Email Classifier using Logistic Regression
- Built a Spam Email Classifier utilizing linear regression and logistic regression models, employing GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and One hot encoding feature engineering to improve predictive accuracy
- Obtained a model accuracy to 90% using the test set; achieved an AUC of 85%

### Movie Classification with Machine Learning
- This is my first data science project using the [*datascience*](https://www.data8.org/datascience/) package, the proprietary Python library developed by UC Berkeley.
- Built a *k-nearest-neighbors algorithm* which classifies movie genre based on the number of times chosen words appear in the screenplay.
- Tested the classification algorithms on movies with multiple genres through cross-validation and Train/Test split with 99.5% accuracy.

### Hybrid Spotify Swipe-based Recommendation System (WIP)
- I am currently working on a Spotify Swipe-based Music Recommendation System, leveraging an extensive dataset containing various track features such as track popularity, danceability, energy, valence, loudness, and more.
- The goal of this project is to enhance user experience by providing personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and listening patterns through the blend of both *collaborative and content-based filtering*.
