# 🛠️ Projects

### 🏦 Stock Market Analysis for Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo
- Applied advanced data analysis and utilized Pandas to extract financial data from [*Google Finance API*](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281?hl=en).
- Conducted *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to identify key events including market crashes and stock splits.
- Analyzed and classified stocks based on riskiness through financial metrics such as moving averages & RSI using *Seaborn's and Matplotlib's clustermap* to visualize correlations between different stocks.
- Crafted a comprehensive financial analysis report that unveils key insights for each bank.

*Skills: Matplotlib · Seaborn · Pandas (Software) · EDA · Data Wrangling*

### 🔮 Stock Market Prediction Model using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) & Sentiment Analysis
- Employed *Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)* RNN to predict stock prices, with 90% accuracy with the market.
- Conducted sentiment analysis on *Elon Musk's tweets* to gain insights on their influences on TSLA prices.
- Created a dashboard using *Streamlit* to visualize stock prices and predictions, integrating sentiment analysis results for comprehensive insights.

### 🍿 Movie Classification with Machine Learning
- This is my first data science project using the [*datascience*](https://www.data8.org/datascience/) package, the proprietary Python library developed by UC Berkeley.
- Built a *k-nearest-neighbors algorithm* which classifies movie genre based on the number of times chosen words appear in the screenplay.
- Tested the classification algorithms on movies with multiple genres through cross-validation and Train/Test split with 99.5% accuracy.

### 🎶 Hybrid Spotify Swipe-based Recommendation System (WIP)
- I am currently working on a Spotify Swipe-based Music Recommendation System, leveraging an extensive dataset containing various track features such as track popularity, danceability, energy, valence, loudness, and more.
- The goal of this project is to enhance user experience by providing personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and listening patterns through the blend of both *collaborative and content-based filtering*.
